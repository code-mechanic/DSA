04. Given a queue Q containing n elements, transfer these items on to a stack S (initially empty) so that front element of Q appears at the top of the stack and the order of all other items is preserved. Using enqueue and dequeue operations for the queue, and push and pop operations for the stack, outline an efficient O(n) algorithm to accomplish the above task, using only a constant amount of additional storage.

05. Given a stack of integers, how do you check whether each successive pair of numbers in the stack is consecutive or not. The pairs can be increasing or decreasing, and if the stack has an odd number of elements, the element at the top is left out of a pair. For example, if the stack of elements are [4, 5, -2, -3, 11, 10, 5, 6, 20], then the output should be true because each of the pairs (4, 5), (-2, -3), (11, 10), and (5, 6) consists of consecutive numbers.

06. Given a queue of integers, rearrange the elements by interleaving the first half of the list with the second half of the list. For example, suppose a queue stores the following sequence of values: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Consider the two halves of this list: first half: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] second half: [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. These are combined in an alternating fashion to form a sequence of interleave pairs: the first values from each half (11 and 16), then the second values from each half (12 and 17), then the third values from each half (13 and 18), and so on. In each pair, the value from the first half appears before the value from the second half. Thus, after the call, the queue stores the following values: [11, 16, 12, 17, 13, 18, 14, 19, 15, 20].
```

```
07. Given an integer k and a queue of integers, how do you reverse the order of the first k elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order? For example, if k=4 and queue has the elements [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]; the output should be [40, 30, 20, 10, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90].
