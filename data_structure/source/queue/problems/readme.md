```
03. Implement a stack using two queue.
```

```
04. Given a queue Q containing n elements, transfer these items on
    to a stack S (initially empty) so that front element of Q appears at the top
    of the stack and the order of all other items is preserved. Using enqueue
    and dequeue operations for the queue, and push and pop operations for the
    stack, outline an efficient O(n) algorithm to accomplish the above task,
    using only a constant amount of additional storage.
```

```
What is the most appropriate data structure to print elements of queue in reverse order?
Solution: Stack.
